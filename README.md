This project uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), so, in order to make it working, install in your local machine or use Docker.

The configuration to the Database can be found on [config/database.js](config/database.js)

## Development

After cloning this project, install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

And run using:

```
yarn dev
```

The urls to access are:

The first time to access the Admin you'll need to create an user.
